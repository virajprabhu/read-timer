Read-Timer is a chrome extension built with JavaScript that provides an estimate of the amount of time it will take to read an article on a webpage. The present implementation uses an average adult reading speed of 200 WPM to compute this estimate. 

The future scope of this extension could include:

* Learning the speed for a user based on the his rate of scrolling through articles

* Providing an estimate of time remaining depending on his scroll position 

* Factoring in the complexity of the article while computing the estimate 

* Factoring in other intangible aspects such as user interest in the topic/ nature of the article (for example, a comic) and so on. 

Run instructions:

* Ensure you have the latest version of Google Chrome.
