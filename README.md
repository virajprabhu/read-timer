Read-Timer is a chrome extension built with JavaScript that provides an estimate of the amount of time it will take to read an article on a webpage. The present implementation uses an average adult reading speed of 200 WPM to compute this estimate. 

The future scope of this extension could include:
1) Learning the speed for a user based on the his rate of scrolling through articles
2) Providing an estimate of time remaining depending on his scroll position
3) Factoring in the complexity of the article while computing the estimate
4) Factoring in other intangible aspects such as user interest in the topic/ nature of the article (for example, a comic) and so on.
